# Addon Guidelines

{% hint style="info" %}
These guidelines are designed to ensure a fair, consistent, and high-quality addon ecosystem for Plex Development products. Adherence to these guidelines is mandatory for all addon developers. Failure to comply may result in the removal of your addon.
{% endhint %}



**Originality and Uniqueness:**

* You are not permitted to publish addons that are substantially similar to existing addons, especially those offered for sale in the Plex Development store. This includes, but is not limited to, clones, near copies, or addons that provide essentially the same functionality with minor alterations.
* Addons that replicate functionality of free addons available in the Plex Development store _may_ be permitted, but must offer significant improvements or unique features to be considered.
* Focus on creating addons that offer new and innovative functionalities, improving the user experience and expanding the capabilities of our products.



**Content and Functionality:**

* Addons must not contain any malicious code, viruses, or other harmful software.
* Addons must not infringe on any copyrights or trademarks.
* Addons must not collect or transmit user data without explicit consent.
* Addons must function as advertised. Misleading descriptions or broken functionality will result in removal.



**Points and Rewards System:**

*   The points awarded for creating and publishing addons are based on several factors, including:

    * More complex and feature-rich addons will generally receive more points.
    * A clear and compelling addon description, including screenshots or videos, significantly impacts the points awarded. A well-written description should explain the addon's purpose, features, and how to use it.
    * Creating very low-quality addons that require minimal effort to create will gain significantly fewer points, or potentially no points at all. We encourage developers to invest time and effort into creating high-quality, valuable additions to the Plex Development ecosystem.



**Community and Support:**

* Addons that are very outdated and do not work with the latest versions of our products may be removed. We understand that maintaining compatibility can be challenging, but we strive to offer a seamless experience for our users. Therefore, we encourage developers to keep their addons up-to-date. If an addon becomes significantly outdated and the developer is unable to provide updates, we may remove it to avoid confusion or compatibility issues.

## Monetizing Your Addons:

If you've developed a high-quality addon and are interested in monetizing it, you can list it on our store. We offer a competitive revenue split, with you retaining the majority of your earnings. We handle the storefront, payment processing, and marketing, allowing you to focus on developing and supporting your addon.



**Here's how it works:**

1. Your addon must meet our quality standards and guidelines. It should be well-documented, functional, and offer valuable features to users.
2. Create a ticket in our Discord server to express your interest in selling your addon. Please provide the following information:
   * The addon files.
   * A short description of the addon and its features.
   * Preview images or videos showcasing the addon.
3. Our team will review your addon and get in touch with you to discuss the details of listing it on the store. This includes setting up the product page with banners, descriptions, and pricing.
4. You will receive a generous percentage of the revenue generated by your addon sales. We take a small commission to cover the costs of running the store and promoting the addons. (15%)
5. Developers who have addons listed on the store will receive an exclusive "Addon Creator" role in our Discord server.
6. You are responsible for maintaining and updating your addon to ensure compatibility and address user feedback.

To ensure quality and variety, we may limit the number of addons a single developer can list on the store.

{% hint style="danger" %}
Developers are strictly prohibited from soliciting or accepting direct payments for addons outside of the official Plex Development store (plexdevelopment.net). All monetization of addons must occur through the platform provided by Plex Development, as described in the "Monetizing Your Addons" section below. Failure to comply with this policy may result in the removal of your addon and other appropriate actions. Requests for exceptions must be submitted via ticket in our Discord server and will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis
