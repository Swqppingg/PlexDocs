I**mportant Note for Web Dashboards**

If you plan to host a **web dashboard**, such as **Plex Store**, **Plex Tickets Dashboard**, or **Plex Staff**, and want to use a **custom domain**, please note the following:

* **VPS Required for Reverse Proxy Setup:**\
  To use a custom domain, you will need to configure a reverse proxy (e.g., Nginx or Apache). This configuration typically requires a VPS or similar hosting solution that provides root access.
* **Access via IP Address:**\
  Without a reverse proxy and custom domain setup, the web dashboards will still function but will only be accessible via the server’s IP address rather than a domain.
