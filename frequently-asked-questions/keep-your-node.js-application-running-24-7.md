# Keep Your Node.js Application Running 24/7

## Option 1: Using screen

### 1. **Create a Screen Session**

A screen session allows the bot to keep running even when you close the terminal. To start a new screen session, run:

```bash
screen -S PlexTickets
```

Now, you're inside the new screen session. _(You can replace PlexTickets with a name of your choice)_



### 2. **Start the Bot**

1.  Navigate to the folder where your application is installed:

    ```bash
    cd /path/to/plex-tickets
    ```

    _(Replace `/path/to/plex-tickets` with the actual path, e.g., `/home/PlexTickets`)_
2.  Start the application by running:

    ```bash
    node .
    ```



### 3. **Detach from the Screen**

Once the bot is running, you can safely detach from the screen session without stopping the bot. To do this:

* Press `CTRL + A`, then press `D (All at the same time)`

You will return to the regular terminal, and the bot will continue running in the background.



### 4. **Reconnect to the Screen**

If you ever need to access the bot or restart it, follow these steps:

1.  List all active screen sessions:

    ```bash
    screen -ls
    ```

    Youâ€™ll see a list of active screens, something like:

    ```
    12345.PlexTickets
    ```
2.  Reconnect to the screen session by running:

    ```bash
    screen -r <screen_id>
    ```

    _(Replace `<screen_id>` with the actual ID, e.g., `12345`)_



### 5. **Stop or Restart the Application**

* To stop the application, simply press `CTRL + C` inside the screen session.
* To restart, run the `node .` command again.



## Option 2: Using tmux



### 1. Install tmux

First you have to install tmux to your vps using:

```bash
sudo apt install tmux -y
```

### 2. Create a tmux session

To create a tmux session you just have to run:

```bash
tmux
```

### 3. Start the bot

Next you have to start the bot by running:

```bash
node .
```

in the plex directory.&#x20;

### 4. Detach session

To detach the session you have to press `ctrl+B` then D.

### 5. Reattach the session

To attach the session again you have to run the command:

```bash
tmux attach -t ID
```

If you dont know the ID yet:

```bash
tmux ls
```



### 6. Stop or restart the bot&#x20;

To restart or stop the but you just have to reattach the session, then press `ctrl+C`
