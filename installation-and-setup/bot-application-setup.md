You can edit your application's name, description, and avatar here. Once you've saved your changes, move on by selecting the "Bot" tab in the left panel.

After creating a bot user, you'll see a section like this:

In this panel, you can give your bot an avatar, set its username, and make it public or private. You can access your token in this panel as well, either by revealing it or pressing the "Copy" button. When we ask you to paste your token somewhere, this is the value that you need to put in. Don't worry if you do happen to lose it at some point; you can always come back to this page and copy it again.
